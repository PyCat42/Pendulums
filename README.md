# Pendulums
Program that simulates chaotic pendulum motion

This program demonstrates how small changes in pendulum starting angle can have a great effect on its motion later on. It simulates two pendulums with a slight difference in their starting angles, along with a graph that shows the change in their angles to the axis over time.

**Note:** You can also run this simulation online: https://glowscript.org/#/user/PyCat42/folder/MyPrograms/program/TwoPendulums
